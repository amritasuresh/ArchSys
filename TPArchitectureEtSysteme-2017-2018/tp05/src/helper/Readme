Some helper scripts used to (partially) generate the data in uni.h.

characters.csv is a condensed version of the UnicodeData.txt file, with
only the characters having interesting normalization properties. All others
have Combining Class 0, have no decomposition, and are not excluded from
composition.

high.csv are simply the ids from characters.csv without the lower 8 bits
(and unique).

primary.csv is another derivation from characters.csv containing the
Primary Composites and their decompositions. (I.e., characters having
a (non-compatiblity) decomposition and not being a Full Composition
Exclusion (fce=0).

plane4.pl partially generates the trie for character lookup and UTF-16
encoding of the decompositions.

primary.pl generates a perfect (but not minimal) hash function for
Primary Composites.
